feat: Implement GlassmorphicModal for data clear confirmation

Replaced native Alert.alert with a custom, visually enhanced GlassmorphicModal for the 'Clear All Local Data' confirmation in settings. This provides a more modern and branded user experience with a liquid glass effect and rounded corners.

- Created `components/ui/GlassmorphicModal.tsx` for the new modal component.
- Updated `app/settings.tsx` to use `GlassmorphicModal` and manage its visibility state.
- Installed `@react-native-community/blur` dependency for the blur effect.
