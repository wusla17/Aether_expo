feat: Implement app-wide theme switching

Introduced a `ThemeContext` to manage and propagate the dark/light mode state across the entire application. This ensures that theme changes made in the settings screen are reflected immediately throughout the app.

- Created `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` to provide theme state and a toggle function.
- Modified `app/_layout.tsx` to wrap the app with `ThemeProvider` and consume the theme state.
- Updated `hooks/useColorScheme.ts` to export `useAppColorScheme` from the new context.
- Modified `app/settings.tsx` to use the `toggleDarkMode` function from the `ThemeContext`.
